Q.On Click Create New Backup it goes to blank page.
<br>Ans: if the site is very large, it takes time to create the backup. And if the server execution time is set to low value, you get go to blank page.
There may be chance your server max execution time is 30 second. Please check debug log file.
You will need to ask your hosting services to increase the execution time and the plugin will work fine for large data.
You can also try to increase execution time. Please make below changes â€“ Add below line

php.ini

max_execution_time = 180 ;
